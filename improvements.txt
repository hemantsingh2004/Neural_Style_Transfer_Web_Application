1. Adding the login and registeration:
    1.1 User will be able to use their previously uploaded images again without uploading them again.
    1.2 Can keep track of various of their activities.

2. Since images are upload on the same storage(server), Adding a method to directly access images for uploadWindow instead of fetching them from backend.

3. Using web-socket to keep the frontend informed about the progress, while using a shared cache like redis to note progress details between express and python.
